Cellular Automata
=================

This is an example implementation of cellular automaton algorithm.
It's short description can be found at [The Mendicant Bug](http://mendicantbug.com/2007/10/28/simple-cellular-automata/ "The Mendicant Bug")
More information about algorithm can be found at [The Mendicant Bug] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton "The Mendicant Bug")

Usage:
$ chmod +x ca.py
$ ca.py <initial data> <neighbourhood bits> <rules set>

Assumptions:
1. nbits - bits number per neighborhood, i.e. 3;
2. data - Initial data which is a number, exponent of two;
3. ruleset - Rules set, 8 bit, i.e. 90;
4. iterations - Recommended number of iterations, i.e. 40;
